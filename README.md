# Physics_JS Background and Overview

- Physics_JS is a user interface experience for demonstrating physics simulation. Initial simulation will involve simulating gravitational effects. Later implementation will include other physical phenomenon that the user can simulate and learn more of about the natural world through online simulation. 

# MVPs 
- Multiple particles. User can set the number of particles on the canvas randomly, adjust the dimensions of the canvas, and set the mass for all particles. 

- Button controls. A start button will begin the simulation. Pause, clear, and inspect buttons will be added. Pause - pauses simulation, clear - clears the canvas, inspect - inspects gravitational force of any two particles. 

- Inspect. The inspector will open up to the side. User selects two particles on the canvas by clicking on any two particles. The gravitational force will then be displayed. 

- (bonus) Single particle event. User can drag and drop single particles anywhere on the canvas after setting the mass for the single particle.

# Architecture and Technology

- the simulation relies on the p5.js library, JS, css, and html to display content to the user. 

# Implementation Timeline 

- 3 days to research and plan. The first day of planing will be devoted to understanding any new technologies required to built project. The second day will continue on learning p5.js and begin prototype phase. The prototype phase will test relevent code that will be needed for the project and discarding others that aren't. The last day will enter final planing - this day is devoted to reviewing all the moving parts that will be needed for all the MVPs and testing each MVP undeo demo circumstances. 

- 2 days to built the MVPs and stylize the webpage.
