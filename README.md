# Physics_JS Background and Overview

- Physics_JS is a user interface experiance for demostating physics simulation. Initial simulation will involve simulating gravitational effects. Later implementation will include other physical phenonemon that the user can simulate and learn more of about the natural world through online simulation. 

# MVPs 
- Multiple particles. User can set the number of particles on the canvas randomly, adjust the dimensions of the convas, and set the mass for all particles. A start button will begin the simulation. Pause, clear, and inspect buttons will be added. Pause - pauses simulation, clear - clears the convas, inspect - inspects gravitational force of any two particles. 

- Inspect. The inspector will open up to the side. User selects two particles on the canvas by clicking on any two particles. The gravitational force will then be displayed. 

- (bonus) Single particle event. User can drag and drop single particles anywhere on the canvas after setting the mass for the single particle.

# Architecture and Technology

- the simulation relies on the p5.js library, JS, css, and html to display content to the user. 

# Implementation Timeline 

- 3 days to research and plan. 2 days to built the first two mvps.
